# Regularizing Irregular Shapes and Finding Symmetry in these shapes

The project is based on regularizing irregular/non-uniform shapes and detecting symmetry in these shapes. 

# OVERVIEW
This project uses different mathematical optimization and machine learning techniques to detect and regularize shapes such as circles, squares and lines from a set of coordinates.

# PREREQUISITES
* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
